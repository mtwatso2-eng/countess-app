# Summary

Countess is a Shiny web app for automating counts of nematode eggs from counting slide images. Our hosted instance of the app can be accessed via a browser at [https://mtwatson-countess.share.connect.posit.cloud/](https://mtwatson-countess.share.connect.posit.cloud/), and the app code can also be run as-is locally or deployed by the user to a Shiny cloud deployment service such as Posit Connect Cloud. The Countess app is built to be accessible to researchers with no coding experience, as it requires no user code to run and has a simple user interface. Also, the app uses cloud resources to run its image analysis pipeline, so powerful hardware on the user side is not required.

# Statement of need

Significance of root-knot nematodes as plant parasites. Need for high-throughput quantitative bioassays, especially in plant breeding programs for resistance. Acknowledge other cases where nematode counting may be useful (including outside of plants). Why counting of eggs, as opposed to other quantification methods? Need for automated counts as opposed to human visual counts for throughput and accuracy. 

Existing tools for nematode egg counting, including our previous Countess code in Colab, which is not a web app and uses an older model.
